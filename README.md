# ToDoList.Maintenance
This part of the To Do List project is where the main work happens. It is called the Backend. The Backend is made using .NET 6.0 and the C# programming language. It does important jobs like adding, changing, finding, and removing to-do items from the list. This part also makes sure that if something goes wrong, the app can find the problem and keep working properly. It's like the brain of the app because it makes all the decisions and does the hard work to manage your to-do items.
